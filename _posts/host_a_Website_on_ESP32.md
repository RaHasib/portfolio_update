## Create a Simple Website Using ESP32 and Microdot

In this project, I‚Äôll show you how to create a simple website hosted on an **ESP32** using **Microdot**, a lightweight web framework for **MicroPython**. The website will be accessible on any device connected to the same network as the ESP32, and you can also use **ngrok** to expose it to the internet.

### Prerequisites

Before we begin, you will need:

- **ESP32 board** with a USB cable
- A computer with **Thonny IDE** or **VS Code** with **PlatformIO** installed
- A **Wi-Fi network** with internet access
- The **MicroPython firmware** for ESP32
- The **Microdot** library for MicroPython

---

### Steps to Follow

#### 1. Flash the ESP32 with MicroPython Firmware

- Flash the ESP32 board with MicroPython.
- Connect the ESP32 to your computer via USB.
- Open **Thonny IDE** or **VS Code** (with **PlatformIO**) and select the correct COM port for the ESP32.
- Ensure communication with the ESP32 through the terminal.

#### 2. Write the Code to Connect ESP32 to Wi-Fi and Start Webserver

- In the root directory of your ESP32, locate or create the file `boot.py`.
- Add the following code to automatically connect the ESP32 to your Wi-Fi network and start the webserver:

    ```python
    import network
    import utime
    from microdot import Microdot, send_file

    # Configure your SSID and password here.
    SSID = "your_wifi_ssid"
    SSI_PASSWORD = "your_wifi_password"

    def do_connect():
        # Initialize network interface.
        sta_if = network.WLAN(network.STA_IF)
        
        if not sta_if.isconnected():
            print('Connecting to network...')
            sta_if.active(True)
            sta_if.connect(SSID, SSI_PASSWORD)
            
            # Wait until connection is established.
            while not sta_if.isconnected():
                pass
        
        print('Connected! Network config:', sta_if.ifconfig())

    # Call the connection function
    print("Connecting to your Wi-Fi...")
    do_connect()

    # Create a new Microdot instance
    app = Microdot()

    # Route the index page to serve 'index.html'
    @app.route('/')
    def index(request):
        return send_file('index.html')

    # Run the server on port 80
    app.run(port=80)
    ```

#### 3. Create an HTML File for Your Website

- In the root directory of the ESP32, create an `index.html` file with the following code to build a simple webpage:

    ```html
    <html>
        <head>
            <style>
                h1 {
                    color: blue;
                    text-align: center;
                }

                button {
                    display: block;
                    margin: auto;
                    width: 200px;
                    height: 50px;
                    font-size: 20px;
                }
            </style>
        </head>
        <body>
            <h1>Welcome to my ESP32 website :)</h1>
            <button onclick="alert('Hello from ESP32!')">Click me</button>
        </body>
    </html>
    ```

#### 4. Add the Microdot Library

- Place the `microdot.py` file from the Microdot library into the root directory of your ESP32.

#### 5. Verify Folder Structure

Your ESP32 folder structure should now look like this:

    ```
    boot.py
    index.html
    microdot.py
    ```

#### 6. Run the Code and Access the Website

- Run the `boot.py` file and wait for the ESP32 to connect to your Wi-Fi network.
- The ESP32's IP address will be printed in the terminal.
- Open a web browser on any device connected to the same network and enter the IP address of the ESP32 in the address bar.
- Your website should now be displayed!
