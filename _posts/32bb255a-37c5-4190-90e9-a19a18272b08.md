### In this project, I will show you how to create a simple website using ESP32 and Microdot, a lightweight web framework for **MicroPython**. The website will be hosted on the ESP32 webserver and accessible from any device on the same network. You can also use ngrok to expose your website to the internet.

#### To get started, you will need the following:

-   An ESP32 board with a USB cable
-   A computer with Thonny IDE or VS Code with PlatformIO installed
-   A Wi-Fi network with internet access
-   The MicroPython firmware for ESP32
-   The Microdot library for MicroPython

#### The steps are as follows:

- Flash the ESP32 with the MicroPython firmware. 
- Connect the ESP32 to your computer using the USB cable and open Thonny IDE or VS Code with PlatformIO. Select the correct COM port for your ESP32 board and make sure you can communicate with it using the terminal.
- In the root directory of your ESP32,  You will see a file name `boot.py`. This file will run automatically when the ESP32 boots up . Try to write some code here to connect to the Wi-Fi network and start the webserver. You can use the following code :
 

```
import network, utime
from microdot import Microdot
from microdot import send_file
    
 SSID = "your_wifi_ssid "
 SSI_PASSWORD = "WIFI_PASSWORD"
    
 def do_connect():
   import network
   sta_if = network.WLAN(network.STA_IF)
    if not sta_if.isconnected():
      print('connecting to network...')
      sta_if.active(True)
      sta_if.connect(SSID, SSI_PASSWORD)
      while not sta_if.isconnected():
       pass
   print('Connected! 
    Network config:', sta_if.ifconfig())
        
  print("Connecting to your wifi...")
  do_connect()
    
   - web server code starts here
  app = Microdot()
    
  @app.route('/')
  def index(request):
    return send_file('index.html')
    
    app.run(port=80)

```


- In the root directory of your ESP32, create a file named `index.html`. This file will contain the HTML code for your website. You can use any HTML tags, CSS styles, and JavaScript scripts you want. For 
      example, you can use the following code to create a simple webpage with a title and a button
 

```
 <html>
    <head>
        <style>
            h1 {
                color: blue;
                text-align: center;
            }
    
            button {
                display: block;
                margin: auto;
                width: 200px;
                height: 50px;
                font-size: 20px;
            }
        </style>
   </head>
   <body>
  <h1>Welcome to my ESP32 website :)
  </h1>
  <button 
  onclick="alert('Hello from ESP32!')">
  Click me
  </button>
  </body>
  </html>

```


- In the root directory of your ESP32, copy the `microdot.py` file from the Microdot library . 
- Your root folder structure should look like this:


```
boot.py
index.html
microdot.py

```


>Run the `boot.py` file and wait until the ESP32 connects to the Wi-Fi network. You should see the IP address of the ESP32 printed on the terminal.
> Open a web browser on any device connected to the same network and enter the IP address of the ESP32 in the address bar. You should see your website displayed on the browser.

I hope this helps you with your project. Have fun with ESP32 and Microdot! üêøÔ∏è
